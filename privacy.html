            <h2>Privacy Policy for Hydra</h2>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 24, 2025</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Hydra ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information in relation to our Discord bot service (the "Service"). By inviting and using Hydra in your server, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

                <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
                <h4>A. Server Configuration Data (Provided by Administrators)</h4>
                <p>When a server administrator configures Hydra, we collect and store the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Guild (Server) ID:</strong> To associate configuration data with the correct Discord server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Channel IDs:</strong> To know which channels to send specific notifications to (e.g., stock updates, weather alerts, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Role IDs:</strong> To correctly mention roles for ping notifications as configured by the server's staff.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>B. User Data and Message Content</h4>
                <p><strong>No Message Content is Read or Stored.</strong> The bot is designed with privacy as a core principle. It does not have the permissions or the logic to read, log, or store the content of user messages in your server. Its functionality is limited to responding to specific slash commands (`/`) initiated by a user.</p>
                <p>We do not permanently store any personal user data, such as User IDs, usernames, or avatars. A User ID may be temporarily used to manage interactive components like a pagination menu, but it is discarded once the interaction is complete.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>2. How We Use Data</h3>
                <p>The data we collect is used exclusively to provide the Service:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To send game-related notifications to the channels you configure.</li>
                    <li>To mention the roles you specify for targeted alerts.</li>
                    <li>To respond to slash commands and provide the requested information (e.g., current game stock).</li>
                    <li>To troubleshoot issues and improve the bot's performance.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
                <p>Server configuration data is stored in a secure database. We take reasonable measures to protect this information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. We do not share this data with any third parties.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
                <p>We retain server configuration data for as long as the bot remains in your Discord server and the configuration is active.</p>
                <p>You can remove your server's data at any time by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using the provided commands to unset or clear channel/role configurations.</li>
                    <li>Removing (kicking) Hydra from your server, which will make your data inaccessible and subject to deletion.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Your Rights</h3>
                <p>As a server administrator, you have the right to access, modify, and delete your server's configuration data through the bot's commands. You also have the right to remove the bot from your server at any time.</p>
